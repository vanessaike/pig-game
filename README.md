This project was made while I was taking The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. I rebuilt the project in order to practice, but the general idea does not belong to me.

## How to play

- Roll the dice and hold your current score when you feel like it. Your total score is the sum of all your dice rolls
- If you hold your current score, it is time for the next player to roll
- If you roll a 1, it is time for the next player to roll
- Reach 100 in your total score and you win the game!
